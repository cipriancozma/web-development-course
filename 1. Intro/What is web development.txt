Q. What web developers do?
Web Developers generally build websites.

Q. What's happening behind the scenes when you enter www.google.com in the browser?
There is a request -> response cycle and it takes a couple of milliseconds.
From the browser when we type www.google.com and press enter, a HTTP request is sent to the server and ask for the data we need.
The server processes the request and sends a response with the Google page (in this case).

This is the main idea but more technically speaking in the moment when you type google.com in the address bar of your browser,
the browser checks the cache for a DNS record to find the corresponding IP address of google.com.
If the requested URL is not in the cache, ISP's DNS server initiates a DNS query to find the IP address of that server that hosts google.com.
After this step when the IP address is find, the browser initiates a connection with the server.
