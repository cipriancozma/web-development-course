HTML is a markup language and it is used to describe our content, to add extra meaning to our content.

HTML element - tell the browser which kind of content is displayed (headings, text, images, ...)

The HTML elements are created using tags (e.g. div, span, h1, ...)

Q. Why do we use html elements?
In this way we can tell to the browser that something is a title, image and allows the browser to present that content correctly
Without this extra annotation, content has no clear meaning
This helps the visitors of the website, the visitors that use assistive technologies (e.g. screen readers) 
and also the search engine crawlers when the website is indexed.

The anatomy of a valid HTML Document (Page)
- Page Metadata -> head, title
- Page Content -> body

Q. Why it's called Cascading Style Sheets?
Styles for elements are taking by top to bottom.
