When exposed to the web, websites are typically served on ports 80 (HTTP) || 443 (HTTPS)

Q. Understanding Cascading, Inheritance & Specificity
Inheritance means that selected container rules apply to descendants
Cascading Style Sheets means multiple rules can be applied to same element
Specificity means that more specific selector's rule wins over less specific selector

Q. CSS Box Model
Content -> Padding (wrapper over the content) -> border -> margin

Q. HTML Layouts
It is important to add semantic meaning to our webpage.
Basically adding structure to a webpage helps SEO, also it is important for keeping the website maintanable.

header -> <header>
navigation bar -> <nav>
main content -> <main> with various content subsections represented by <article>, <section>, <div> elements
sidebar -> <aside>, often placed inside <main>
footer -> <footer>

Q. Selectors & Combinators
type -> element name
ID -> #id
group selector -> element name, element name
class -> .class

Combinators:
Descendants -> li p -> all p with li as ancestor
child -> h2 > p -> only p that are direct children of h2
